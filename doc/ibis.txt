MOTIVATION                                                              *ibis*

(Neo)Mutt and Alpine are very good terminal mail clients, but they lack of Vim
mappings. You can emulate, but it requires a lot of time, patience and
configuration. Why trying to emulate, when you can have it in Vim? VimL and
Python are strong enough to do so. The aim of Ibis is to provide a simple mail
client that:

  - Allows you to manage your mails inside Vim
  - Does not slow down neither Vim nor your workflow (lazy)
  - Uses an `IMAP python lib` {1} to avoid
    implementing IMAP protocol logic

Feel free to submit pull requests: https://github.com/soywod/ibis.vim/pulls

1) Git commit messages follow the Angular Convention{1}, but contain only a
subject.
>
  - Use imperative, present tense: ‚Äúchange‚Äù not ‚Äúchanged‚Äù nor ‚Äúchanges‚Äù
  - Don't capitalize first letter
  - No dot (.) at the end
<
2) Vim and Python code should be as clean as possible, variables and functions
use the snake_case convention, and constants the uppercase snake case. A line
should never contain more than 80 characters.

3) Tests should be added for each new functionality. Be sure to run tests
before proposing a pull request.
